### Why tho?

All the auto clickers out there were either really outdated, old, buggy and/or have legacy code bases. This one aims to fix all that giving you flexibility and style. Plus, I get to write in easter eggs, who says love can't be colourful.

## Downloads

Checkout the [releases page](https://github.com/othyn/macos-auto-clicker/releases) for direct App downloads. Here you can find the latest stable release and any pre-release builds too. There is also a compiled app binary in `dist` directory ready for use.

At the moment, the app is unsigned as I don't (yet) have a paid dev cert, so it _may_ not work for you. If thats the case, clone the project and build a copy using your own dev cert as you would any normal xcode project.

## Usage

It should hopefully be straight forward, hopefully 🤞 if not, drop an issue and I'll see what I can do! The main thing is remembering to allow the required permissions, in which to do so continue to read on...

### macOS Security

You may recieve a popup when first using the app that the app cannot be verified, this is as at the moment I don't have a paid Apple developer account so I cannot notarize the app.

When first using the app, you may need to right click and select the 'Open' option to provide a new prompt that will allow you to trust the app going forward and to open it as normal.

### macOS Permissions

The app requires Accessibility permissions to be granted in order to enable the click functionality, without it the app won't be able to click and will appear to be doing nothing. You should be automatically prompted by macOS to enable this, so to enable it;

1. Open System Preferences
2. Click 'Security & Privacy'
3. Click the padlock in the bottom right to make changes
4. Select 'Accessibility' from the left side list
5. Click the plus button at the bottom left of the list and find the `Auto Clicker.app` file to add it to the list _if it doesn't already appear in the list_
6. Click the checkbox to the left of the 'Auto Clicker' app to check it if its not already checked
7. Restart the 'Auto Clicker' app

## Development

This is a side project, so feel free to submit a PR for any functionality/bug fixes and go ham. There aren't any contributing guidelines or code styles as of yet.

Make sure you open the project via the `*.xcworkspace` Workspace.

### macOS Permissions

I ended up doing [a post on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71276964/4494375) as there were no answers to this question already, but I was having issues with app permissions during development. Found a way to do this after some trial and error, navigating through Xcode's (>11, currently 13) new build system.

1. Open System Preferences
2. Click 'Security & Privacy'
3. Click the padlock in the bottom right to make changes
4. Select 'Accessibility' from the left side list
5. Click the plus button at the bottom left of the list and find the `Auto Clicker.app` file to add it to the list that we put within the project directory, this should be something like `$GIT_CLONE_DIR/macos-auto-clicker/auto-clicker/derived_data/auto-clicker/Build/Products/Debug/Auto Clicker.app`
6. Click the checkbox to the left of the 'Auto Clicker' app to check it if its not already checked
7. I've found that after each build, you will have to un-check and re-check the app in the list to get it to work again, so its worth leaving up during development

Any builds should now have the relevant permissions.

Just to note though, this will overwrite the permissions of any archived/prod builds as the app names and binaries are the same. They are easily added back though, just delete the permission for the build app and instead point it back at your prod app, usually in `/Applications`.

## Testing

Hey00000, this needs implementing.

## Changelog

### Version 1.2.0

Various functionality tweaks alongside UI/UX changes.

#### Added

- Added a Workspace `auto-clicker.xcworkspace` that should be worked from which allows for easier local relative build paths so permissions can be given more easily to allow for clicking functionality to work
- Click interval is now measured in selectable; Milliseconds, Seconds, Minutes and Hours. This makes the click interval selection much more intuitive
- There are now two more readouts for 'Next click at' and 'Final click at' that will show what date/time the next and final clicks will occur at
- Instructions to this README on setting up macOS permissions that the app requires

#### Changed

- Updated `dist/README.md` with new instructions for Xcode 13
- Updated button styling to be more visually appealing and easier to read
- Upped the maximum amount of clicks to 100,000,000 to allow for a 'virtually unlimited' mode
- Instead of a checkbox, the start delay is now a user inputted variable between 0 (instant) and 60 seconds
- The 'Remaining clicks' and 'Currently clicking at' UI elements are now Text View's instead of disabled TextField's
- Updated screenshot with new UI

#### Fixed
